# E-news-Express
Project: This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

# Skills and Tools Covered
Hypothesis testing, a/b testing, data visualization, statistical inference

# My Learnings
During the preparation of this project, many statistical tests were covered to investigate claims about data and ultimately, supported or did not support these claims. The project itself demonstrates the application of these tests in the scope of a business problem and how their findings can be used to direct business decisions. The statistical tests in this project include: 2-Sample Independent T-test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Two Proportion Z-test, Chi-Square Test of Independence, Levene's test, and One-way ANOVA test.
